# CNN-Architectures---deep-learning
Implemented VGG_16, ResNet_18 and Inception V2 CNN Architectures in TENSORFLOW with different optimization techniques. The best weights for every model are saved using earlystopping regularization, these weights are saved in hd5 format. All the observations and understandings are in the above report.pdf
